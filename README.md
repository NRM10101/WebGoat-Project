# WebGoat Project

## Overview
WebGoat is an open-source deliberately insecure application created to teach web application security lessons. It offers an interactive environment where developers can practice identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, learn about various security issues, and improve their coding skills.

This project provides a sandbox for users to practice and learn how to exploit real-world vulnerabilities. Each lesson includes detailed instructions and a challenge for the user to solve.

## Features
- **Interactive Lessons**: Learn web security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and more.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Try to exploit real vulnerabilities in a safe environment.
- **Modern Web Technologies**: The project is built using Spring Boot and Java.
- **Customizable**: You can add or modify lessons as per your requirements.

## Project Structure
- **/webgoat-container**: Main application source code.
- **/webgoat-lesson**: Lesson modules and exercises.
- **/webgoat-server**: WebGoat's backend server implementation.
